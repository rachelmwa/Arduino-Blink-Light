# Arduino-Blink-Light

## Description
C++ code used to command an LED light connected to microcontroller, Arduino system, from the breadboard to blink on and off for a set amount of seconds with delay.

## How Program Works
- Jumper wires connects to pins on Arduino from breadboard
- Resistors used to control flow of power to LED
- Arduino IDE used in C++ to blink on and off LED in a set time interval

## Hardware Used
- Arduino
- Resistors
- LED
- breadboard / jumper wires

## Software Tools
- Arduino IDE
- C/C++

## What I Gained
- Using GPIO and a hardware embedded system
- Software and hardware debugging
- Microcontroller experience
